  and funfilled environment. With all those Isipathana College is producing a great result in year 5 scholaship every year.</br></li>

 <li> <dl> <dt>School has allowed the students to follow thier A/L studies in 4 main streams namely </dt>
 <dd> Biology</dd>
 <dd> Maths </dd>
 <dd> Commerce </dd>
 <dd> Art </dd>
 </dl>
 But we have given wide range of selection for all the students who are studying in all the streams.  So students will get a better chance to <br>
 study the subjects they like and it will make a big impact on the result. And school is ready to provide them any help they need. Through out </br>
 the past couple of years school is being producing lots of university qualifiers from school. And also all those students have got the oppotunity </br>
 to head the associations in the school which will be profitable to thier future job market.</br>
